            <img id="hike" src="./assets/Images/Mike_on_hike.JPG" alt="Mike on a hike">
            <p>I am a student attending the UC Berkeley full-stack web development bootcamp.  I have had an interest in coding for some time, but have never taken serious action to learn the skill…until NOW!  I enjoy surfing, hiking, baseball, and classical piano. I'm eager to learn more and practice more so that I can make great projects with ease!
