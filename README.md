# Portfolio-page-showcasing-web-developement-coding-skills-by-Mike-Seaman
This is a website that serves as a portfolio for all of Mike Seaman's current and future coding projects.  It's destined to grow! At this time, the main page showcases four projects, two of which are finished and two of which are not.  The two complete projects are 1) a webpage code refactoring project and 2) a CSS cheatsheet that was created in collaboration with my classmate William Crane.  The two incomplete projects are 1) a baseball graph project and 2) a surfing highlight reel project. There is also a brief "About Me" section so the user can feel like they've gotten to know me a little bit. When the user clicks on any of the links, they are taken to another page.  Some of those pages are rendered from HTML files that are within the project itself.  The baseball project, for example, loads a new html file and there are 6 links in that page, each leading to yet another html file.  For the baseball project, I decided to use a separate CSS file called "baseball.css."  I wasn't sure if this is common practice, but I wanted to try to separate the styling.

## Languages Used
This project primarily involved the HTML and CSS languages. However I also used command line, git, and github for storing the project in a repository and github pages for deployment

## Key Features
- Flexbox functionality, including wrap, align-items, justify-content, grow/shrink, and more
- psudo-classes such as :hover
- meadia queries to make the pages render nicely on different sized screens
- variables for reuse of colors
